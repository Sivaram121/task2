1. Create a file with .txt extension (/home/demo.txt). Change the permission set if that file, so that any user can read it, group can read/write & owner can read/write/execute it.

 --> sudo touch /home/demo.txt  [To create a demo file inside home]
 --> sudo chmod 764 demo.txt [To give the read and write permissions]
